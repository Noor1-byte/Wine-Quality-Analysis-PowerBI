# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the **Wine Quality Dataset** using Power BI to identify patterns in chemical properties such as Alcohol, Density, pH, and Volatile Acidity.

The dashboard combines:
- 📊 **Wine Quality Distribution** bar chart  
- 🔍 **Scatter plots** (Alcohol vs Quality, Volatile Acidity vs Quality)  
- 📈 **Histograms** for Alcohol, Density, and pH  
- 🧮 **KPI cards** for quick insights  

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Most wines have Alcohol between **10–12%**, Density ~1.0, and pH 3–4.  
- Higher alcohol % is associated with better quality.  
- High volatile acidity reduces quality significantly.  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**  
- **DAX Measures**  
- Data Visualization & Dashboard Storytelling
